# Sentiment Analysis using VADER and RoBERTa Pre-trained Model

## Overview

This repository has been created with a primary focus on sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves the application of computational methods to determine and understand the emotional tone or sentiment expressed within textual data. In the context of this repository, sentiment analysis is conducted using two powerful models: VADER and RoBERTa.

## Methodology

The sentiment analysis employs two distinct models: VADER, a rule-based sentiment analysis tool suitable for social media text, and RoBERTa, a transformer-based model known for its robust performance in various natural language processing tasks. The analysis assesses the sentiment of McDonald's reviews to gain insights into customer opinions and preferences.
