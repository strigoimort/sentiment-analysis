# Sentiment Analysis using VADER and RoBERTa Pretrained Model

## Overview

This repository focuses on sentiment analysis using VADER and RoBERTa pretrained models, aiming to analyze and classify the sentiment of text data. The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of McDonald's reviews by Nidula Elgiriyewithana. The sentiment analysis results are compared between VADER and RoBERTa models, with RoBERTa demonstrating higher accuracy in predicting sentiment.

## Methodology

The sentiment analysis employs two distinct models: VADER, a rule-based sentiment analysis tool suitable for social media text, and RoBERTa, a transformer-based model known for its robust performance in various natural language processing tasks. The analysis assesses the sentiment of McDonald's reviews to gain insights into customer opinions and preferences.

## Data

- McDonald's Reviews by Nidula Elgiriyewithana (Kaggle)

## Analysis

Jupyter Notebooks scripts showcase the sentiment analysis process using both VADER and RoBERTa models. The scripts illustrate data preprocessing, model training, and sentiment prediction steps. The comparison between the two models reveals that RoBERTa achieves higher accuracy in sentiment classification when applied to the McDonald's reviews dataset.

## Results
